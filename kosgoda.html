            <h4>TURTLE HATCHERY</h4>
            <p>Kosgoda turtle-hatchery is one of 18 turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of Sri
                Lanka. The centre is located in the South Western coastal village of Kosgoda and was establised in 1981.
                All five species of turtles that visit Sri Lanka nest in Kosgoda. This is not
                so with many of the other hatcheries around the island whose beaches host only some of the species.</p>

    <p>Situated a few kilometres north of the main Hikkaduwa town lies the Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Centre, a
        centre with the aim of conserving some of the endangered species of turtles in the world. It is just one of
        many turtle hatcheries in the southern coast of the island. Initially starting as a community project to
        help protect the biodiversity of the southern coast, it is now a fully-fledged hatchery and rescue centre
        with dedicated teams that work round the clock to study, care and protect several turtle species</p>

        <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
        <p>The centre functions mainly as a hatchery and makes huge efforts to increase the rate of hatching, and
            survival of baby turtles in their very initial stages. however the care centre also works on sick or injured
            adults; treating them and releasing them back into the ocean. they also run volunteer programs and awareness
            programs for local and international visitors.</p>
